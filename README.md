# **Use case-3 : Predict Customer Sentiment**
*The main aim of this project is to clasify customer sentiments:*
-- POSITIVE SENTIMENT
-- NEGATIVE SENTIMENT
-- NEUTRAL SENTIMENT

## **Overview:**

In today’s competitive world where Airlines companies are struggling to maintain their margin it becomes imperative to not only add new set of customers to the portfolio but equally important is retaining the customer loyalty. Understanding your current customer reaction to the services is key to maintaining a strong relationship.

Business wants to capture the customer feedback shared in Twitter about the flying experience of recent time which company  wants to understand and act upon; any negative sentiment has to be identified on a near real time basis  and customer should be reached out to understand the problem and also get themes around complaints to put in place a strategic plan.


## **Problem:**
In the current world, there is no *automatic system* in place to find whether customer's feedback is positive or negative or neutral. 

## **Solution:**
Build a classification model to decide whether it is a positive or negative or neutral category. Also, build a system to understand themes around the customer's feedback.   
The data has feedback of different airlines; feel free to use all data and show sentiments across operators
